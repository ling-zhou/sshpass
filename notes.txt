UNIX 98 pseudoterminals
   An unused UNIX 98 pseudoterminal master is opened by calling
   __posix_openpt__(3).  (This function opens the __master clone device__,
   __/dev/ptmx__; see pts(4).)  After performing any program-specific
   initializations, changing the ownership and permissions of the
   slave device using __grantpt__(3), and unlocking the slave using
   __unlockpt__(3)), the corresponding slave device can be opened by
   passing the name returned by __ptsname__(3) in a call to open(2).

When a process opens /dev/ptmx, it gets a file descriptor for a pseudoterminal master (PTM),
and a pseudoterminal slave (PTS) device is created in the /dev/pts directory.
Each file descriptor obtained by opening /dev/ptmx is an __independent PTM__ with its own
associated PTS, whose __path__ can be found by passing the descriptor to __ptsname__(3).

Before opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the master's file descriptor to
__grantpt__(3) and __unlockpt__(3).

Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave provides __processes__ with an
__interface__ that is identical to that of a real terminal.

Data written to the slave is presented on the master descriptor as input.
Data written to the master is presented to the slave as input.

In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal emulators such as xterm(1),
in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is interpreted by the application in the
same way a real terminal would interpret the data, and for implementing remote-login programs
such as sshd(8), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is sent across the network
to a __client program__ that is connected to a terminal or terminal emulator.

BSD-style pseudoterminals are considered __deprecated__

FILES
       /dev/ptmx (UNIX 98 master clone device)
       /dev/pts/* (UNIX 98 slave devices)
       /dev/pty[p-za-e][0-9a-f] (BSD master devices)
       /dev/tty[p-za-e][0-9a-f] (BSD slave devices)

A pseudoterminal (sometimes abbreviated "pty") is a pair of
virtual character devices that provide a bidirectional
communication channel.  One end of the __channel__ is called the
__master__; the other end is called the __slave__.
